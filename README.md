# Analyzing cultural biases in Wikispeedia

## Abstract
In the last few centuries, Western societies like Europe and the USA have become wealthier and wealthier compared to
African or Asian countries. This has also come with a faster technological development, meaning that the early internet
was dominated by Western culture. Today, content on the internet is still still mostly produced by Western societies [[1]](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Decolonizing_Wikipedia.pdf) [[2]](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/05/internet-white-western-google-wikipedia-skewed#:~:text=of%20the%20world.-,For%20the%20first%20time%20in%20history%2C%20we%20are%20creating%20a,skewed%20towards%20rich%2C%20western%20countries.). In this project, we will analyze the impact this had on
[Wikispeedia](https://dlab.epfl.ch/wikispeedia/play/), an online game built on 4604 Wikipedia articles from 2007 during which players are navigating from a given start and end article only through the links contained in the articles. We intend to answer several questions: Are people players more likely to click on articles linked to Western countries? What are
the most used articles in Wikispeedia paths? Are there unconscious biases in the way players choose their paths? Do they tend to follow paths that connect articles from Western countries? Is that because
Wikipedia contains a larger proportion of articles about Western culture, or are the players themselves biased? 


## Data
The articles that we will use have been borrowed from a 4,600-article version of Wikipedia that was once available at the 2007 Wikipedia Selection for schools. We have the content of the articles (*data/plaintext_articles*) as well as data of the Wikispeedia games (*data/wikispeedia-paths-and-graph*). 


## Research questions
1. Are there cultural biases intrinsic to the Wikipedia graph?
   * What countries are the most present in the Wikipedia graph?
   * Are articles about some countries on average more connected than others?
2. Are there cultural biases in the way players play Wikispeedia?
   * What articles are most often clicked on? How does this relate to the country of the article?
   * What paths do Wikispeedia players most follow? Are there "highway paths" that are very often used? Can this be
linked to a cultural bias?
   * What articles are most likely to cause a player to stop the game? What makes those articles "dead ends"? What does
   this have to do with the country of these articles?
3. How can we explain the players' biases?
   * What is the distribution of countries among start / target articles for the Wikispeedia games? If it is not balanced, could this be an explanation?
   * Can we explain the variance in player's click counts with the number of links leading in and out of article?
   * How does the players' clicking behavior compare itself to PageRank? Are players significantly more biased than a random walk on the graph?
   * Is there something inherent to the way players play the game?

## Methods

### 1. Are there cultural biases intrinsic to the Wikipedia graph?

### Assign countries to articles
First, we assign one or multiple countries to each articles of the Wikispeedia dataset. This will then be useful to
determine to which region of the world (and thus to which culture) a given article belongs to. To assign each article to a country we did two things: 

- First a naive approach is used by doing a text search and finding all the country string names inside the plaintext. This is done with help of a regex that matches all the countries in all the files. The results are then parsed in a table containing as index the article name and as columns all the possible countries on earth along with the number of occurences in the specific article. After this the top 2 countries per articles are kept. This approach resulted in 1412 articles having no country assigned to them. By going manually through them it can be seen that as a human some articles can be further classified to countries even if the country name is not explicetly mentionned in the text.
- Two LLM's were tested (Qwen and Llama) and only Llama (a Meta LLM) was retained in order to assign the missing articles to countries. For this to be done the LLM was downloaded locally and used for inference on the plaintext articles. This approach allowed to classify 525 new articles having no country assigned to them. Articles classified with help of the LLM have a "Top_1_count" of 0 meaning 0 occurences of the exact country name in the article but stil able to be inferred by an llm.
- Some articles remained unclassified, as they represent entities that cannot be easily associated with a country (for example objects, celestial bodies, raw materials).

#### Links between articles
To find the number of links in and out of each article we simply counted the number of links in each article (this is the number of links out) and then counted the number of times an article occurs in other articles (this is the number of links in). 

### 2. Are there cultural biases in the way players play Wikispeedia?
#### Click counts
Here we were interested in understanding whether there is a cultural bias in the way players of the Wikispeedia game click on articles, meaning whether some articles are clicked more often and whether some countries are associated to articles that are more often clicked. 

The click count of an article is defined as the total number of times it appears across all Wikispeedia paths (i.e. ```data/paths_finished.csv``` and ```data/paths_unfinished.csv```)
Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$\text{Click Count}_{\text{article}} = \sum_{p=1}^{P} \text{Occurrences}_{\text{article}, p}$$

Where:
- $ P \ \text{represents the total number of paths in the datasets.}$
- $\text{Occurrences}_{\text{article}, p} \ \text{indicates the number of times the article appears in the p-th path.}$


#### Highway paths
In this part, the focus is made on player's behaviour to investigate whether they use some paths more often than others. Those frequently used paths are called "highway paths".
- Extract each game path from paths_finished.csv and paths_unfinished.csv as a list
- Create a new list with every 1-unit long path between articles (returns to previous articles '<' are carefully taken care of by removing the last article accessed from the list)
- Normalize the number of occurences of each pair by the total number of pairs found
- Associate each pair of article to the top 1 country of both articles
- Repeat a similar procedure for 2-unit long path between articles by extracting trios of articles from game paths

#### Dead ends analysis
In this section, we analyze "dead ends" in the Wikispeedia game by examining points where players frequently abandoned their paths before reaching the target. This includes tracking the success and failure rates of articles, associating dead-end articles with specific countries, and scaling click counts by the number of outgoing links.

The success and failure ratios are defined as follows:

$$\text{Success Ratio} = \frac{\text{Successful Clicks}}{\text{Total Clicks}}$$
$$\text{Failure Ratio} = \frac{\text{Failure Clicks}}{\text{Total Clicks}}$$
--- 
To incorporate scaling, the total clicks are adjusted by the number of outgoing links for each country, as expressed in the formula:
$$\text{Scaled Total Clicks} = \frac{\text{Total Clicks}}{\text{Outgoing Links}}$$

This scaling highlights the influence of article connectivity on player behavior, providing deeper insights into cultural patterns and player strategies across different regions.

### 3. How can we explain the players' biases?

#### Analyzing country distribution in start / target articles of proposed paths
We isolate start and end articles from paths and analyze the distribution of countries among them.

#### Regression analysis of the click counts
To investigate whether some inherent features of articles could influence le number of clicks that an article will receive in the Wikispeedia game, we performed a ordinary least squares regression using the number of clicks are the predicted/dependent variable and combinations of the number of links in and out of articles as predictors/independent variables. We also performed correlations to find relationships between these three variables. 

#### Comparing with random walk

The basic PageRank algorithm of the `networkx` package was run on the full graph of the Wikispeedia game. The ranks were then compared with the players rank, defined as:
$$r_a = \frac{c_a}{\sum_{a' \in A}{c_{a'}}}$$
where
* $c_a$ is the click count of the article $a$ (the number of times it appears in the recorded player paths)
* $A$ is the set of all articles in the Wikipedia graph

To remove as much bias from the graph as possible in the players rank (given that we want a fair comparison between the PageRanks which represents the graph's inherent bias and the players rank which represents the players' bias), we removed the start and target articles from the players paths before computing click counts. Those articles are not actually chosen by the players but are imposed by the game, so they do not represent the players' bias. Initial comparison of players vs PageRank was done.

The players and PageRank ranks were then aggregated by country for further analysis. The rank of a country was defined as:
$$r_c = \sum_{a \in A_c} r_a$$
where
* $A_c$ is the set of all articles linked to the country $c$

An analysis of the difference between the players and PageRank ranks was done to determine if players are significantly more biased than a random walk on the graph. Statistical significance was tested using a chi-square test with a number of trial $n$ set to the total number of clicks in all the recorded games.
